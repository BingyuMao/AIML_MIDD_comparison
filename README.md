## Overview

This project explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for population pharmacokinetic (PPK) modeling within the context of model-informed drug development (MIDD). It provides a comparative analysis between traditional nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modeling approaches, such as NONMEM, and a range of AI-based models, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The evaluation is conducted using both simulated datasets and real-world clinical data, with a focus on predictive performance across various modeling scenarios.

## Steps to reproduce the AI/ML results
